### Executive Summary


#### Lucidchart
My first look at lucidchart was a bit odd since I didn't quite understand how to use it but after playing around with it I realized it was pretty simple and that it has everything you really need for a flowchart. I was looking at templates and trying to understnad what I was suppose to do but then something just clicked and everything just felt easy from there and on.

#### Introduction to Networking
##### Data Transmission
All of the terms match with the corresponding definitions because they're all directed toward sssomeone or something, whether it's a house adress or a persons phone. For example, IP Adresses are people's specific internet connection for their device, if someone finds this and discovers it is you then that matches all the definitions given. For DNS it is jsut the same as an IP Adress but for a phone, protocol is a communications system, packet is a system of given data, packet-switching is just a group of data giving information with numbers. 
##### Networking Hardware
All a hub specificially knows is whether data is connected to one of it's ports, it doesn't know any data but it can transfer it to the other ports around it. A switch can learn the address of the devices which makes it able to send data to the port its drected to instead of sending it to all of the other ports as well. Switches block any unnecesary traffic unlike the hubs. Hubs and switches can only transfer and communicate locally within each others network but a router can go further beyond that.  A router is even better since it reads IP adresses and it forwards data based on the IP address, it's a gateway to a network. Hubs and switches use networks while the router connects the networks.
