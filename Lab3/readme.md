### Executive Summary 


### Software
Software is made up of three roles which are application, utility, and operating system software. Application software are the categories of programs that do something useful for the user, for example, when you open any browser like firefox, safari or google chrome. Utility software allows you to repair or maintain your computer in whatever way you feel, some examples are antivirus softwares, disk repairs, and newtwork managers. Operating systems create interfaces and manage the hardware, examples of operating systems are Microsoft Windows and macOS. ERP systems utilize central database that's already inputed by the whole organization, examples of ERP systems are SAP, Oracle and Microsoft. Virtualizations are also know as virtual machines and they're known to run a physical server or host independently. This is different from cloud computing because cloud computing is when they have shared resources and are dependant. 

### Virtualization 
Virtualization can fix many types of problems like using multiple operating systems for different apps and servers. In virtualization hypervisors take physical resources and divides it so the virtual enviornments can use it.

### Python
In a pseudo-code python it focuses on the problem and to fix it rather than codes itself. Pseudo code could mean that it's a secondary solution than going straight for the codes itself. An interpreted language is a source code that translates to a native language on your computer and runs it through, in a compiled language converts the lanuage of your computer with flags and options, it runs from the hard disk to memory and then runs. 

### Career Exploration
Under the Beuro Labor of Statistics I found that Computer Programmers are starting to decline and make around $80,000 a year with just a Bacholers degree. and just over 250,000 people have jobs in this field and some don't even need job experience of this type to work in the field. 
#### College Central
I found on College Central that there are many opportunities for me to find internships around me since I searched for IT within 25 miles and a lot of places like Berea, Westlake, and Avon Lake showed up. 
#### Certifications 
In Cisco certifications it allows you and makes you practice to get ready and persue your career with their certificates.
