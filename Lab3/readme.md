### Executive Summary 
In this lab I will be explaing and demonstrating some pictures and codes of software, python, career paths and certifications. Software is going to be about how it is made up and hows everything gets put together into it. Software has many interesting things that I don't even know much about. Python is a coding application that makes it's own language through your computer which is exciting. Some career paths make more of a salary than other but in IT they are enormous compared to some jobs that don't take many years of school or thinking since IT usually deals with technology and technology is always rising. Some websites also have certifications for your needs whether it is entry level, advanced, expert or a proffesional. Certification is always needed to show that you know what you know. Now let's beging with how software is made up and the roles of it. 

### Software
Software is made up of three roles which are application, utility, and operating system software. Application software are the categories of programs that do something useful for the user, for example, when you open any browser like firefox, safari or google chrome. Utility software allows you to repair or maintain your computer in whatever way you feel, some examples are antivirus softwares, disk repairs, and newtwork managers. Operating systems create interfaces and manage the hardware, examples of operating systems are Microsoft Windows and macOS. ERP systems utilize central database that's already inputed by the whole organization, examples of ERP systems are SAP, Oracle and Microsoft. Virtualizations are also know as virtual machines and they're known to run a physical server or host independently. This is different from cloud computing because cloud computing is when they have shared resources and are dependant. 

### Virtualization 
Virtualization can fix many types of problems like using multiple operating systems for different apps and servers. In virtualization hypervisors take physical resources and divides it so the virtual enviornments can use it.

### Python
In a pseudo-code python it focuses on the problem and to fix it rather than codes itself. Pseudo code could mean that it's a secondary solution than going straight for the codes itself. An interpreted language is a source code that translates to a native language on your computer and runs it through, in a compiled language converts the lanuage of your computer with flags and options, it runs from the hard disk to memory and then runs. 

### Career Exploration
Under the Beuro Labor of Statistics I found that Computer Programmers are starting to decline and make around $80,000 a year with just a Bacholers degree. and just over 250,000 people have jobs in this field and some don't even need job experience of this type to work in the field. 

#### College Central
I found on College Central that there are many opportunities for me to find internships around me since I searched for IT within 25 miles and a lot of places like Berea, Westlake, and Avon Lake showed up. 

#### Certifications 
In Cisco certifications it allows you and makes you practice to get ready and persue your career with their certificates. Even if you are just a lowely entry level canidate you can still successfully achieve a certificate, associates, proffesionals and experts can as well even if they are at a higher ranking. It's also more of a short term certificate type degree.

#### Certificates
At Tri-C certificates they have whole bunch of selections of jobs from an Associates degree of Programming and Development all the way to fast track learning for Cleveland codes.

#### Co-op/Internships
To be considered co-op ready you must have a 2.75GPA or high and enrolled in Community College along with 12 credit hours. With an uploaded resume and your career of interest you can become accepted. For an internship you get an experience with hands on people in your feild and get to work with them. Although internships don't count as credit hours.

#### Industry Association/ Student Organizations
The purpose of IEEE is to advance technology for humanity in general to live and do better things in life. A membership would be benificial because when you're a member you have tons of resources to look through and get the new technology trends. Also having the IEEE experience looks good on any resume and could get you a job at many places. There is usually a local area that is very into IEEE as well and with this you can get a job even easier. 

### Conclusion
Starting to learn about software, Python and different career paths I could go is definitly something that makes me more excited for the class. Learning more and more to make an improvement in life and school is like hitting two birds with one stone. Before doing research I didn't know how impactful the software and virtualizations were together. I also never knew how to use python but making some codes definitly got me out of my seat since it just seemed so amazing to me. The industries and intereships possible are enourmous in the IT world. It's fairly high in demand and pays highly which is great for people like me that are interested in codes and IT in general.
