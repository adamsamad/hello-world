### Executive Summary 


### Internet Architecture 
##### Internet Protocol
An IP Address is a number your computer network and is given so data is sent to the right location. IPv4 had over 4 million unique IP Addresses but only 3.7 million being allowed for ordinary services and the rest for special occasions. In IPv6 it was massive compared to IPv4, it's said to last us longer than 30 years. IPv4 only had 32-bit addresses while IPv6 has 128-bit adresses. ICANN distributes IP Adress blocks to five Regional Internet Registries around the world and then from there it breaks down into smaller people making more IP Adress blocks. This contributes to global internet because it gives everyone who uses the inetrnet an IP Address to send and recieve information.

##### TCP/IP 
TCP/IP defines data and defines how it is sent and recieved through modems, routers, hubs and other communication hardware. The client server applies to this because the client needs to dial the information the TCP/IP needs and then the server of the TCP/IP then sends the data over. Layers are important to change in technology because each layer communicates with the stacks above and below it making it easier and faster. Layers can keep being added without affecting the other layers around it. The TCP/IP only uses 4 layers while the OCI uses 7 layers. Applications like HTTP and FTP are considered application layers. 

##### Internet Security
HTTP is used for viewing webpages on the internet. It's used with the client-server mondel because it gives the client information and then the server sends the information by loading the website. HTTP uses a secure HTTP by encrypting the data that's being sent to HTTP, it uses a special algorithim to scamble data so it can't be hacked.
