### Executive Summary


### File Compression
Compressing a file is making it a zip file. A zip file compresses the file so it can take up less space in the computer and it is able to be transfered and sent quicker. Another way to make a zip file is to attach multiple documents to one file and then send it to someone or computer so it doesn't take too long. Instead of sending bigger documents one by one and it taking much longer to send zip files make this much easier and quicker. Before compressing the svg file it was 33KB and after making a zip file it before a smaller 31KB. This wasn't a very big difference but if there were multiple images or documents that I needed to send quickly it would all add up and would be much more worth it. If these were jpg files then the images would be much bigger and cause a hastle when sending, they would also be much larger causing the file to be bigger.
