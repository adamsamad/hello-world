### Executive Summary


### Data, Information and Knowledge
#### Relational Data 
Data are pieces of informations with no explanations, raw data is simple information given with no context. Information is whats given and it's any piece of data or knowledge that goes into the computer, like the memory in the hard ware and software. Knowledge is used to make decisions, policies and have innovation. The primary key in the orders and customers table is to get their orders correct. The customers and orders are related because the customers order off of the menu. The foreign key would be for the customers to recieve their order correctly. It's important to properly define the data because if the data is wrong it could mean something different, for example, if you brang the order for one table to another.

#### Big Data 
Volume represents the amount of data you can have and is one of the main characteristics that makes data big. Velocity represents the motion of the data and how it moves and how quickly it can move. Variety defines all the different types of resources and data it can collect. Veracity is reliable with how trustworthy it's data is, and with it's calculation noises, bias and abnormality. Technology like R, Hadoop, Data Lakes and NoSQL Databases are things that need BIG DATA since they all need to be trustworthy, secure and always good to use. 

### Structured Query Language
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems. The purpose of SQL is to let you access and manipulated multiple databases, without out it you wouldn't be doing much. For the diagram I chose "Orders" and "Customers." In these the primary key would be the Orders since it is supplying the items, and the foriegn key would be Customers since they are browsing different items and can recieve different items. The relationship is that they both have information that needs to be put in correctly so nothing goes wrong or gets missing by communication error.
